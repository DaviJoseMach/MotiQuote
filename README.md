# Motiquote

  

Motiquote is a React application that brings you an inspiring collection of motivational quotes. With a modern and responsive interface, you can explore, copy and share quotes that will energize your day.

  

## Technologies Used

  

-  **React**: Library for building user interfaces.

-  **JavaScript**: Main language of the project.

-  **Axios**: For HTTP requests.

-  **React Router**: For navigation between pages.

  
## API Used

Motiquote now uses its own custom API to deliver a unique collection of motivational quotes. Our API combines quotes stored locally in the project directory, giving us greater control, along with additional quotes sourced from the cloud. All quotes are seamlessly integrated into a single JSON file.
